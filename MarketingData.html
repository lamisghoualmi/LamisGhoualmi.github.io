  <h1>Description of the dataset</h1>

  Marketing Campaign Results in Marketing campaign data results of 2,240 customers of Maven Marketing, 
  including customer profiles, product preferences, campaign successes/failures, and channel performance.
  
  <h2>The proposed methods to analyse this dataset:</h2>
  <p>The proposed data pre-processing includes the following steps.
    First, clean up the column names by checking the meaning and removing the space if there is any. Second, fix the
    misspelling and misclassified observations. Third, variables with more than 40% missing values will be removed. Finally,
   I analyze the numeric variables of the data set to check for any suspicious outliers. To handle this problem,
    we calculate the statistical values of the data (average, max, min, percentile.., etc). Then we extract
    the suspected variable that might have potential outliers, we plot the variable using a boxplot
    to get the threshold that allows us to remove observations with outliers.</p>
