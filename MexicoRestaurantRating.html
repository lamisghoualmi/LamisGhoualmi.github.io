    <h2>Tasks to do and our insights from the analysis:</h2>
    <p>  What can you learn from the highest rated restaurants? Do consumer preferences have an effect on ratings? </p>
    <p>The highest rated restaurant was selectedusing a SQL query [select * from restaurants where Restaurant_ID  in
         (select Restaurant_ID from ratings where Overall_Rating=2 and
        Food_Rating=2 AND Service_Rating=2)] then analysed using Tableau. From the reported results, we can say that the 
        the highest restaurants have a medium prices, propose Mexican cuisine, don't have parking, don't allow smocking, dont 
        offer alcohol  and most of they are located in San Luis Potosi state because it's a touristic state</p>
        
         

         <p> What are the consumer demographics? Does this indicate a bias in the data sample? </p>
         <p> The consumer demographic is single, students who are independent don't have children and have a medium budget. 
            Yes, from the donut chars illustrated in my dashboard I can say that the is a bias in the data sample because 80%
           of the population of the data represents single students and this will lead to some false positive insights.</p>

           <p>Are there any demand & supply gaps that you can exploit in the market?</p>
           Yes, The customer need more mexican food with a medium price. For the supply, I am not seeing variables related to
            supplies.

           <p>If you were to invest in a restaurant, which characteristics would you be looking for?</p>
           <p>If I want to invest in  a restaurant, I will invest in a restaurant that offer mexican food with a medium price.
